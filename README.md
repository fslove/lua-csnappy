===========

Introduction
------------

lua-csnappy is a binding of the `csnappy` library which implements the Google's Snappy (de)compressor.

Snappy uses a [LZ77](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78)-type algorithm with a fixed, byte-oriented encoding.

The `csnappy` library is available at [http://github.com/zeevt/csnappy](http://github.com/zeevt/csnappy).

The specification and the original C++ implementation of Snappy are available at [http://code.google.com/p/snappy/](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/).
